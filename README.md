# Leavers_Process365

Converts a leavers mailbox to shared, removes the licence, asks if you want to:
    1. Add An out of office
    2. Add any full access permissions
    3. Remove the account from the GAL

Each module has some idiot proofing, so they'll loop back in the event a wrong answer is given. **YES YOU CAN PROBABLY STILL BREAK IT. COOL**
